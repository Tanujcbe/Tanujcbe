- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Go-based cold email generator that tailors outreach messages based on industry and company.  
  It’s a small tool, but it solves a real problem I’ve faced: sounding personal without spending 30 minutes on every message.  
  I gave myself a 1-day limit, used it as an excuse to learn Go, and shipped something useful. That’s how I learn best — by building real stuff fast.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to ship value with less code.  
  My focus isn’t on chasing buzzwords — it’s on mastering fundamentals across different stacks (Go, FastAPI, infra automation) and building microtools that devs or founders actually want to use.  
  Right now, that means going deep into:  
  • Go for performance-heavy tooling  
  • Developer UX in CLI and API interfaces  
  • AI-assisted backends (security, prompt protection, PII filters)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on backend-focused tools, dev infra, and open-source projects that help developers move faster.  
  Especially interested in developer platforms, observability tools, and anything that merges AI with clean backend architecture.  
  I prefer shipping small + iterating fast over debating forever in Slack threads.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting visibility for high-utility open source projects — especially from founders or hiring teams that appreciate speed, practicality, and builder energy.  
  If you’ve built distribution around a technical project, I’d love to learn from you.

- 💬 Ask me about backend design, building MVPs that don’t look like MVPs, or navigating the early-stage chaos as a backend/devops engineer in a startup.  
  Also happy to share how I structure 1-day builds that still look polished and purpose-built.

- 📫 How to reach me:  
  Best way — [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanuj-m/)  
  Or drop me an email at: tanujofficial8[at]gmail[dot]com  
  Or just fork a repo, open an issue, and start a convo — I’m always up for building something interesting.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I once built a working backend MVP in 10 hours just to win an argument.  
  It worked. The person is now a paying user.
